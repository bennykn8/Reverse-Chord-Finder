# Reverse-Chord-Finder
## Description: 
   Reverse-Chord-Finder is a tool to assist in musical studies. 
   It takes user input of a series of note names (ex: C, E, G) and outputs the corresponding name for the group of notes, known as a chord(ex: C Major Triad).

## Understanding the program:
   Chords can be categorized in many different ways.
   One way to describe a chord is by determining the chord's "quality" (ex: major, minor).
   When played, major chords are described as sounding happy or resolute while minor chords are described as sad or melancholic.
   There are formulas for these qualities and what determines them is the interval/distance between each note.
   For example, a major chord contains intervals 4 and 3.
   Take C, E, G (C major): it takes 4 notes going up from C chromatically to reach the second note E. Then from E it takes 3 notes to reach G.
   There are many variables that must be taken in when identifying a chord like inversions, extended notes, etc but the basic formula is always found somewhere in the pattern.

## Limitations:
   This program as of now has the following limits:
      • can't skip/ leave out notes in a chord
      • only chord lengths 3-6
      • limited to common types: major, minor, diminished, augmented, 7th chords

## Background:
   I'm a percussionist in my school band and I enjoy play keyboard mallet instruments. 
   I haven't taken music theory nor am into composition but felt a need that I should understand what I'm playing on a deeper level.
   Identifying chord is just the surface level to understanding music but it is a valuable step in becoming the complete musician.
   It can be difficult to remember all of the types of chords and I figured why not just write a program to help me!
